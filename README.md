Ballistic-Model-for-CVD
=======================

These are codes for calculating the steady-state flux distribution in trenches with straight or tapered sidewall. You can either create your own reaction function for two molecule reactions, superconformal MgO coating for example, or you can give an arbitrary sticking probability for single molecule CVD.
